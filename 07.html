    <h1>Lullaby</h1>
    <h2>Lullaby</h2>
    <p>
        Will you lay me down?
        Make our hearts the only sound
        Throw my fears all to the ground
        Will you hold me?
        Will you serenade me
        With the song you used to play?
        'Til the night turns into day
        Will you hold me?
        'Cause all I need is somebody near me
        When my heart gets weak
        Somebody out there watching over me
        When I'm so tired, I can't even sleep
        Won't you sing me your sweet lullaby?
        Just the sound of your voice is the thing that I need
        Won't you sing me your sweet lullaby?
        I could fall for the sound of your sweet melody
    </p>
    
    <h1>Lullaby2</h1>
    <p>
        
        'Cause I just need your song
        Something to sing along
        When I'm not feeling strong, I need you
        To sing me your sweet lullaby
        Need the sound of your sweet melody
        So sing to me
        So sing to me
        Need the sound of your sweet melody
        So sing to me
        I'll be there when you're down
        'Cause forever, I am bound
        For my love, I shout it out
        Let me hold you
    </p>
