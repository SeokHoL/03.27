            <h1>Listen</h1>
            <p>Listen to the song here in my heart
                A melody I start but can't complete
                Listen to the sound from deep within
                It's only beginning to find release
                Oh, the time has come for my dreams to be heard
                They will not be pushed aside and turned
                Into your own all 'cause you won't
                Listen
                Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
                I'm not at home in my own home
                And I've tried and tried to say what's on mind
                You should have known
                Oh, now I'm done believing you
                You don't know what I'm feeling
                I'm more than what you made of me
                I followed the voice you gave to me
                But now I've gotta find my own
                You should have listened
                There is someone here inside
                Someone I thought had died so long ago
                Oh, I'm screaming out and my dreams'll be heard
                They will not be pushed aside on words
                Into your own all 'cause you won't
                Listen</p>

            <h1>Lullaby</h1>
            <p>Will you lay me down?
                Make our hearts the only sound
                Throw my fears all to the ground
                Will you hold me?
                Will you serenade me
                With the song you used to play?
                'Til the night turns into day
                Will you hold me?
                'Cause all I need is somebody near me
                When my heart gets weak
                Somebody out there watching over me
                When I'm so tired, I can't even sleep
                Won't you sing me your sweet lullaby?
                Just the sound of your voice is the thing that I need
                Won't you sing me your sweet lullaby?
                I could fall for the sound of your sweet melody
                'Cause I just need your song
                Something to sing along
                When I'm not feeling strong, I need you
                To sing me your sweet lullaby
                Need the sound of your sweet melody
                So sing to me
                So sing to me
                Need the sound of your sweet melody
                So sing to me
